  <p>
    I am from Hong Kong and currently majoring in Computer Science.  
    After graduation, I plan to work in a job related to computer science, ideally as a computer engineer.  
    In 10 years, I hope to be a successful CPEN working on meaningful tech projects.

    Outside of school, I enjoy playing video games, biking, and swimming.  
    One fun fact about me: I love collecting things that remind me of childhood, like this Pooh & Piglet toy.
